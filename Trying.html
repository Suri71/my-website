<h1>When you want something real bad, you will have to do something real hard</h1>
<p>When you start feeling that you have been working hard for a long time 
   and have harvested nothing desired till the day, you got to shut that mofo up 
   and tell him that you should be working even more harder to get what you desire</p>
